## Development

### Test

```bash
npm test
```

### Package

```bash
npm run package
```

This creates `build/package.zip` containing the compiled skill - this can be uploaded directly to AWS Lambda. It exposes a single function `index.hander`. Skill utterances defined in the `model` directory are expanded and output to `build/UTTERANCES`.

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If you configure the project with AWS credentials then you can build, test, package and deploy the project with a single command. You can check it out in the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/bible).
